/***********************************************************/

This is code independent of the original LPA* and A* code. This
comparison of LPA* and A* in mazes was coded from scratch to benefit
A* (for example, edge costs are no longer set to infinity but the
edges are deleted, the time it takes A* to expand a vertex was
decreased, and so on). The results were obtained on a PC.

Warning: Use with caution. This code is for research purposes only. We
assume no liability whatsoever. Please send bug reports to skoenig@cc.gatech.edu.
