%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type. Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text. Look at previous Project abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Paper length}
Project papers may be between 6 pages and 8 pages.  

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Writing in \LaTeX}\label{sec:tutorial}

If you have not used \LaTeX\, before there are a number of online tutorials.  One tutorial I like can be found on \url{http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/}.

\subsubsection{Editing \LaTeX\, documents}

\LaTeX\, documents, with extension {\tt .tex} (such as this file) are plain text files.  They can be edited in any text editor.  However, make sure those files are saved as plain text files (not, \eg, Microsoft Word documents).

One other option is to use LyX, a (quasi) WYSIWYG document processor that can create tex-compatible documents.  You can learn more about LyX on \url{http://www.lyx.org}.

\subsubsection{Typesetting \LaTeX\, documents}

Once you've created your {\tt .tex} file you'll need to "compile" it to produce a PDF document.  On DCS systems this can be done in the following way:
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   > latex egreport_for_review.tex
   > bibtex egreport_for_review
   > latex egreport_for_review.tex
   > latex egreport_for_review.tex
   > ps2pdf egreport_for_review.ps
\end{verbatim}
}

This will create the file {\tt egreport\_for\_review.pdf}, which you can then submit.

If you have {\tt pdflatex} installed on your system you will not need to do the last step above (converting from postscript to PDF).


\subsection{Mathematics}

Writing mathematical expressions and formulae in \LaTeX\, is very easy.  For example, you can define the expectation operator as
\[
  \mathbb{E}[x] = \int_{x \in {\cal X}} x p(x) dx.
\]

The above equation is not numbered, which is not a good idea if you are submitting a manuscript.  To get numbered equations do this
\begin{equation}\label{eq:my_eq}
	\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \int_{x \in {\cal X}} f(x) p(x) dx.
\end{equation}

You can then refer to this equation as (\ref{eq:my_eq}).  For more on this topic see the above tutorial in Section~\ref{sec:tutorial}.

\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2in} \rule{0.9\linewidth}{0pt}}
   %\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{egfigure.eps}
\end{center}
   \caption{Example of caption.  It is set in Roman so that mathematics
   (always set in Roman: $B \sin A = A \sin B$) may be included without an
   ugly clash.}
\label{fig:long}
\label{fig:onecol}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not. The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.) However, use it only when there are three or more authors. Thus, the following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors. If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors11} to \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors11}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54 cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4 paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm) high.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type. Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank lines after the title.

Camera-ready final version only: AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}. Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type. Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements}) should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like. It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly. Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence). If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{Authors11}. Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered. Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper. Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render effectively in print. Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it. You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{Figure file formats}

Your best choice for figure file formats are vectorized graphics, such as EPS (encapsulated postscript) or PDF.  For things such as bitmapped images you will obviously not be able to use vectorized graphics, but those can be also converted into one of the above two formats.  

MATLAB can generate either, although one should be careful when using MATLAB-generated PDF.  For more details on how to generate proper PDF figures from MATLAB see PMTK function {\tt printPmtkFigure}.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy. However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important information is lost by the conversion to grayscale.
